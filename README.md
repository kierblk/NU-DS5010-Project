# NU-DS5010-Project

## Overview


The purpose of these projects is to gain hands-on experience working on a non-trivial programming project in a collaborative team. The project task is to implement a simple Python package designed around a specific purpose of your choice.
Projects are to be completed in teams of 2 - 4 class members. The project is worth a total of 30% of the class grade, and includes a written project proposal, a written report, and a package repository. Each team should work independently on their own projects, but may collaborate on technical questions via Piazza and Github. Make sure to proofread your proposal and report – it should appear polished and professional.
Projects may utilize existing external libraries as long as there is no significant functional overlap with the project package. If the project makes significant use of external libraries, then the proposal and report must clearly state which aspects of the project are the teams’ novel effort. Projects with a very high degree of similarity with other past or current students’ work, or with other existing work (e.g., found online), which are not clearly cited, will be considered plagiarism. In such instance, all team members will receive a zero on the project, and will be reported to the university.
Each project is expected to be hosted on a public Github repository owned by one of the team members. This is to encourage openness and reproducibility, by allowing your code to be easily reviewed by instructors and other students. Please do not include large datasets or large binary files in your repositories.
